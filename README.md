LogLookup - a python program that extracts a callsign from a formatted log file
and passes it to QRZ.com via their API. The person's name and address are
returned.

Written from bits of code provided by Jim Eden, N1ZKO.

Note that the paths to the log and config files are hard-coded and will need
to be changed to suit the user's needs. A file chooser will be incorporated
into the program at a later date (i.e. as soon as my skillset allows).
